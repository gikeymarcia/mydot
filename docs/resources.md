# mydot project resources

As a FOSS commoner, I live and thrive by the sharing of knowledge by others. In 
this light, I'll use this document to point to the most useful resources I've 
found in helping me problem solve my way through this task.

### Background

First heard about dotfiles and taking control of my computing experience from 
youtubers. Mostly, DT (Derek Taylor), Luke Smith, and Jay of LearnLinuxTV. 
Formally to understand what a dotfile repository is you can read the [Atlassian 
guide][].

Read the [first time git setup][] if you've never used `git` on your system. 

## Python

### `Pathlib.Path`

```python
# make the TLDR samples
```

Followed along with the excellent [RealPython tour of pathlib][pathlib] and read 
up when needed in [the documentation][doc-pathlib]

[doc-pathlib]: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>
"pathlib -- object oriented file system paths"
[pathlib]: <https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/>
"Python 3's pathlib module -- taming the file system"
[first time git setup]: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>
"Git - First-Time Git Setup"
[Atlassian guide]: <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles>
"The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository"
